# GIT intermediate level (aka beyond the basics)

This session aims at consolidate your knowledge about GIT, introducing good
practices and collaborative features [1]. I'll focus on branches usage and the
feature branch workflow. I will also present additional handy commands, and
features from online platforms such as github.

The session is hands-on the keyboard, so you test new concepts as they are
illustrated and strengthen your muscle memory.

To attend, you'll need to be familiar with basic shell commands (ls, cd...) and
git commands (clone, add, commit, pull, push).

[1]: "collaborative" means with other people and also with future yourself ;-).


## Additional handy commands (~45 min)

- gitignore
- git reset
- git commit [-av] with long message

- git stash
- git revert
- gitk or other viewer

- emphasize fast add/commit cycle + pull/push, commit often


## Branching (1 hour)

- git branch (+ git checkout [-b])
- git tag
- git merge

- feature branch workflow


## Collaborative platforms (1 hour)

- fork and pull request
- tickets systems
- good practices (e.g. good commitizen)


## Bonus (probably skipped)

- git blame
- git rebase
- git subtree
- git filter-branch
- ...
